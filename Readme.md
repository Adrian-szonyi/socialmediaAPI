## Description

This Social media API runs on Mongoose and has the back end routes set up to allow the user to create, delete, update and find all users. It also allows the creation of reactions and thoughts which are like social media posts. Users can also add other users as friends. There is no front end built yet for this API.

## Installation

The application has been set up to on the node server and uses mongoose. Users will need to run npm i to install the files in the package.json There is also Moment being used for the date info and it's running on an Express server so I would recommend using Insomnia to view the routes.

## Tests

After installing the npm files you can start the server and test the routes using Insomnia
